MR-Android-Remote (The 2008 Time Capsule) 📱🦕    
    
Language: Java (Android)   
Status: 🦕 Fossil / Legacy Code    
Year: 2008-12 (Android Stone Age)    
What is this?   
    
This is a Wi-Fi Remote Control I wrote back in 2008 to control my "Media Revolution" Windows player.   
It was developed in Motorola Studio before Android Studio even existed.   
Features (Back in the Day)    
   
    UDP Sockets: Custom protocol to send commands (Play, Stop, Forward) over Wi-Fi.   
    Live Cover Art: Receives raw bitmap data via UDP and displays the album art on the phone.   
    Playlist Browser: Read text files from the SD card.   
    No Internet Required: It used raw network sockets (no APIs, no cloud).   
   
⚠️ Warning   
    
This is archival code.
   
    It was written for very old Android versions (likely Cupcake/Donut, i have no idea anymore).   
    The IDE (Motorola Studio) is extinct.   
    It probably won't compile on modern Android Studio without a time machine.   
   
Why upload it?   

maybe still some can use some of the ideas      


    btw -> the apk of it still works today :D
